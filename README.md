Problem Statement - Pollution levels are rising due to traffic, industries, and waste mismanagement, harming health and the environment. Lack of real time monitoring and data-driven action makes it difficult to control and reduce pollution effectively

The warning follows UK government data that shows significantly more tiny pollution particles now come from tyre erosion than are emitted from vehicle exhausts.

The report estimates 52% of all the small particle pollution from road transport came from tyre and brake wear in 2021, plus a further 24% from abrasion of roads and their paint markings. Just 15% of the emissions came from the exhausts of cars and a further 10% from the exhausts of vans and HGVs.

Solution - WE PROPOSE AN AI-BASED TYRE & BRAKE WEAR PREDICTION TOOL WHICH CAN ANALYZE DRIVING PATTERNS, ROAD CONDITIONS, AND VEHICLE USAGE TO PREDICT WHEN TYRES OR BRAKES NEED REPLACEMENT BEFORE EXCESSIVE WEAR OCCURS.

 ECO-DRIVING AI ASSISTANTS CAN PROVIDE REAL-TIME DRIVING FEEDBACK TO MINIMIZE AGGRESSIVE DRIVING, EXCESSIVE BRAKING, AND SHARP TURNS THAT INCREASE TYRE AND BRAKE WEAR.
