Problem Statement - Pollution levels are rising due to traffic, industries, and waste mismanagement, harming health and the environment. Lack of real time monitoring and data-driven action makes it difficult to control and reduce pollution effectively
The warning follows UK government data that shows significantly more tiny pollution particles now come from tyre erosion than are emitted from vehicle exhausts.

The report estimates 52% of all the small particle pollution from road transport came from tyre and brake wear in 2021, plus a further 24% from abrasion of roads and their paint markings. Just 15% of the emissions came from the exhausts of cars and a further 10% from the exhausts of vans and HGVs.
