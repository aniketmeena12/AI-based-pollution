PROBLEM STATEMENT - Pollution levels are rising due to traffic, industries, and waste mismanagement, harming health and the environment. Lack of real time monitoring and data-driven action makes it difficult to control and reduce pollution effectively

The warning follows UK government data that shows significantly more tiny pollution particles now come from tyre erosion than are emitted from vehicle exhausts.

The report estimates 52% of all the small particle pollution from road transport came from tyre and brake wear in 2021, plus a further 24% from abrasion of roads and their paint markings. Just 15% of the emissions came from the exhausts of cars and a further 10% from the exhausts of vans and HGVs.

SOLUTION - WE PROPOSE AN AI-BASED TYRE & BRAKE WEAR PREDICTION TOOL WHICH CAN ANALYZE DRIVING PATTERNS, ROAD CONDITIONS, AND VEHICLE USAGE TO PREDICT WHEN TYRES OR BRAKES NEED REPLACEMENT BEFORE EXCESSIVE WEAR OCCURS.

ECO-DRIVING AI ASSISTANTS CAN PROVIDE REAL-TIME DRIVING FEEDBACK TO MINIMIZE AGGRESSIVE DRIVING, EXCESSIVE BRAKING, AND SHARP TURNS THAT INCREASE TYRE AND BRAKE WEAR.

MISSION - Our mission is to leverage AI-driven technologies to minimize non-exhaust emissions from road transport by predicting tyre and brake wear, optimizing fleet maintenance, and enhancing urban air quality

PROCESS - We can collect data through IoT sensors like brake wear, temperature, accelerometer etc. Sensor transmits the data via MQTT or Bluetooth AI identifies risky driving behaviors that accelerate wear Maintenance is scheduled proactively, reducing breakdowns and emissions

GOALS - Reduce Non-Exhaust Pollution like minimizing particulate emissions from tyre and brake wear using AI-driven insights, Implement AI models to forecast tyre and brake wear, preventing unexpected failures, Detect excessive wear early, reducing the risk of accidents caused by faulty brakes or tyres, Support eco-friendly driving habits and reduce environmental impact

CHALLENGES -   Data accuracy, real-time processing, and variability in driving conditions. High implementation costs and the need for advanced IoT infrastructure make adoption difficult. Ensuring data security and privacy is also crucial for connected vehicle systems.

ACHIEVEMENT -  AI-driven solutions have significantly reduced non-exhaust emissions, improving air quality and road safety. Predictive maintenance has helped prevent unexpected failures, optimizing fleet operations and reducing costs. By extending the lifespan of tyres, brakes, and vehicle components.
